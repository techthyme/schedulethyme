# UX

Creating a website that will allow people to attend events. Events can be created by users as well.

**Home page (/page.tsx)**
This is where users are going to see the call to action to either view events or to schedule one.

**Events page (/events/page.tsx)**

Displays a list of events that a user can click on and view its details.

**Event page (/events/[id]/page.tsx)**
When the user clicks on an event on the events page, the details of the event will be rendered with this page. Also, this is where the user will be able to click on the "Attend" call to action. This call to action will trigger a modal that will collect the information of the user needed for them to attend the event.

**Profile page (/profile)**
Users are able to view their profiles via this page

**Schedule page (/calendar/)**
