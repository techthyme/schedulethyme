1. User Access & Profiles: we're going to mock out the profile page for now as this is going to be a demo. 
- User registration & login (with email/social login)
- Profile management (basic info, business type, interests: food, tech, agro, etc.)
- Role-based access (user vs. admin vs. trainer/consultant)
2. Scheduling & Booking
- Facility Booking: currently implementing the logic to handle the event booking. Antonio was able to connect google calendar to the application so the next thing will be to allow events to be created and saved to the scheduletyme google calendar. 
- Choose location (Kitchen A, Collaboration Space, Training Room, etc.): when creating an event the user will be able to select the resources for that event. 
- Select date/time & availability check: for now we're not going to have any availabaility management
- Pricing/rental terms (if applicable): the terms and pricing will be added as rules on resources. the price for an event will be generated based on those rules. 
- Training Registration: users will be able to search for events such as training programs and request top attend.
